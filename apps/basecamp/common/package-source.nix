# The source tree one role package is built from.
#
# The Logos module builder copies a package's QML view directory into the
# package as-is. Both desks use the shared UI kit in common/qml, so the kit is
# merged into the role's src/qml here, in a derived source that the aggregate
# flake and the per-role catalog flakes all build from; the catalog's
# lgx-portable output therefore ships the kit (#50).
#
# qmllint then resolves every import and type the view names against that
# directory and the pinned Qt, so a package whose view would fail to compile
# in Basecamp fails to build instead of failing to load. Only unresolved
# imports and types, and syntax errors, are refused; style warnings are not.
